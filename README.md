# TikTok-Project-Regression-Analysis

You are a data professional at TikTok. The data team is working towards building a machine learning model that can be used to determine whether a video contains a claim or whether it offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently.

The team is getting closer to completing the project, having completed an initial plan of action, initial Python coding work, EDA, and hypothesis testing.

The TikTok team has reviewed the results of the hypothesis testing. TikTokâ€™s Operations Lead, Maika Abadi, is interested in how different variables are associated with whether a user is verified. Earlier, the data team observed that if a user is verified, they are much more likely to post opinions. Now, the data team has decided to explore how to predict verified status to help them understand how video characteristics relate to verified users. Therefore, you have been asked to conduct a logistic regression using verified status as the outcome variable. The results may be used to inform the final model related to predicting whether a video is a claim vs an opinion.

A notebook was structured and prepared to help you in this project. Please complete the following questions.

### Course 5 End-of-course project: Regression modeling
In this activity, you will build a logistic regression model in Python. As you have learned, logistic regression helps you estimate the probability of an outcome. For data science professionals, this is a useful skill because it allows you to consider more than one variable against the variable you're measuring against. This opens the door for much more thorough and flexible analysis to be completed.

**The purpose** of this project is to demostrate knowledge of EDA and regression models.

**The goal** is to build a logistic regression model and evaluate the model.
This activity has three parts:

**Part 1**: EDA & Checking Model Assumptions

* What are some purposes of EDA before constructing a logistic regression model?
**Part 2**: Model Building and Evaluation

* What resources do you find yourself using as you complete this stage?
**Part 3**: Interpreting Model Results

* What key insights emerged from your model(s)?

* What business recommendations do you propose based on the models built?

Follow the instructions and answer the question below to complete the activity. Then, you will complete an executive summary using the questions listed on the PACE Strategy Document.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.
